Dear ChooseLove Recruitment, 

This application uses the following softwares/services:

- Webhook
- Express.js/Node
- Zapier
- Airtable
- Bubble.io
- Postman (for requests)

It is to be noted that this project has struggled to meet the Bubble.io expectations, as my primary focus has been to ensure smooth flow of data through webhook and airtable software.

You will find an Airtable.js file, as well as a controller, service & app.js - which will configure the requests needed to make report updates.
I have attached all necessary links and information, and look forward to meeting with you tomorrow.
